is manditory to put <!DOCTYPE html> to indicate that we are starting html
To open and close a tag like a title or head or !DOCTYPE html you use < title> to open and < / title> to close the tag
Some tags can self close such as < br /> which is a line break code it can be used anywhere
When an element is found in another element it is considered the child of the element 
Comments are essential to code, comments are used to explain what your code does when you run it.
Comments are not visible to readers
To open a comment you simply type <!-- "desired text" --> 
Whitespace is used to make it easier for the readers to do their job. 
By putting evrything on different lines the readers can clearly identify two different paragraphs as opposed to all of it being on one line.
Paragraphs contain plain text
< div> can contain any kind of text and can be used to seperate html documents </ div>
to emphasise something add < em> in front of what you want to be emphasized </ em>
strong makes text stronger or bolt it 
< video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls> </ video> allows you to paste a video into the website,dont forget to add width and height
You can add links to a web page by adding an anchor element < a> </ a> and including the text of the link in between the opening and closing tags.  

headings and sub-headings,  h1> to  h6> tags, are used to enlarge text.
 p>,  span> and  div> tags specify text or blocks.
The em> and  strong> tags are used to emphasize text.
Line breaks are created with the  br> tag.
Ordered lists  ol>) are numbered and unordered lists  ul>) are bulleted.
Images img>) and videos video>) can be added by linking to an existing source.
Anchor tags  a> are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.
You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using anchor tags and addings ids to the elements you wish to jump to.
The nav element contains links to internal pages or content.
				
				
				
	<h2>table notes</h3>
	
	
	The table> element creates a table.
The tr> element adds rows to a table.
To add data to a row, you can use the td> element.
Table headings clarify the meaning of data. Headings are added with the th> element.
Table data can span columns using the colspan attribute.
Table data can span rows using the rowspan attribute.
Tables can be split into three main sections: a head, a body, and a footer.
A table's head is created with the thead> element.
A table's body is created with the tbody> element.
A table's footer is created with the tfoot> element.
All the CSS properties you learned about in this course can be applied to tables and their data.
	
	<h2>formating CSS</h2>
	
	css notes:

	Used to style web pages
	Can be used to modify or change colour and font size on the page
	Even though CSS is different, it can be directly written in HTML
	You can place a style function in the head element to modify the way it looks (for example:< p style="color: red;">I'm learning to code!</ p>) This is how we use inline styling 
	Inline styles are a quick way to style an HTML document
	You can chnage the font size and color by doing the following: < p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">I'm learning to code!</ p>
	By adding  p {font-family: Arial;} we can change the font of the text
	To make life easier you can seperate HTML and CSS into two different sections 
	To do so you will have to link both files with an "href" and a link tag
	Once they are linked in CSS you can select which section you would like to modify
	For example if you wish to edit h1, in CSS you simply write h1 followed by squiggly brackets and the modifications you would like to be made
	You can select class atributes sush as title to edit all you need to do is: .title and squiggly braquets
	You can add more than 1 class name to an HTML class atributes
	After creating the class atrubutes in CSS go into index HTML and add whatever class you made to the description you want to edit
	Classes and id's have different purposes which can affect which one you use to style HTML elements
	It is possible to have two or more css selectors at the same time
	to do so we have to combine multiple selectors which we will call chaining 
	The only thing more specific than ID's is:!important
	It can overide almost anything and his very hard to reverse
	Font size allows you manipulate the size of the text
	Font weight allows us to make text bold
	Text allign allows us to center your text you can put your text to the left, right, and center
	Te box model is basically code hidden in a box
	You can adjust the size of your paragraphs by setting the code min-width and max width
	The overflow property controls what happens to content that spills, or overflows, outside its box.
	hidden - when set to this value, any content that overflows will be hidden from view.
	scroll - when set to this value, a scrollbar will be added to the element's box so that the rest of the content can be viewed by scrolling.
	visible - when set to this value, the overflow content will be displayed outside of the containing element. Note, this is the default value.
